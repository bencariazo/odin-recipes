    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This succulent roasted pork belly topped with green avocado sauce is a win with the entire family. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul> 
            <li>2 lbs pork belly, sliced into 3/4 Inch strips</li>
            <li>8 cups water- enough water to cover the pork belly</li>
            <li>2 cup of cooking oil</li>
            <li>1 small yellow onion (remove skin and cut into quarters)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of black pepper peppercorns</li>
            <li>6 bay Leaves</li>
            <li>8 cloves of fresh garlic</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of salt</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Using a very sharp or serrated knife, score the top/fat side of the pork belly about a 1/4 inch deep every 1/4 inch (this allows the pork skin to get crispy).</li>
            <li>Bring water to a boil in a large cooking pot. Add in the black pepper peppercorns, bay leaves, garlic, onion and salt.</li>
            <li>Place strips of pork belly in the pot, cover and boil for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Remove pork belly from the pot. Place it on a sheet pan with paper towels and pat dry. Allow it to cool down.</li>
            <li>Place in fridge overnight, uncovered, to allow it to air dry.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep frying pan to 350 degrees. Deep fry pork belly until crispy and golden brown on one side, then flip it over and fry other side (roughly 8-10 minutes per side). Remove from pot once both sides are crispy and place on paper lined sheet pan to absorb excess oil.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with salt or your favorite Cajun seasoning for extra flavor. Serve with Fresh Guacamole.</li>
        </ol>
